					I started working as an electrician out of high school and it was fun but definitely not something I was hoping to do for the rest of my life. While working there I moved up and continued to learn and grow. After working for about a year I went to the Junior College located near me. I was pursuing a graphic design degree. I took two classes while working and after taking those courses I realized I would not be able to continue with school unless I stopped working. I didn't have enough time while working six days a week. I was working there for about two years when I was talking to a friend one day and they were getting into development. I always had an interest in computers so this sounded fun. Just a few months after talking to them, I enrolled at Bottega. Bottega's accelerated courses helped me learn a lot. I live in Saratoga Springs with family and am planning to move out soon with my soon to be fianc√©. I also love video games, hanging out with friends and family, playing board games and going hiking.
